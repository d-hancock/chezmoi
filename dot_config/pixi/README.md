# Pixi Configuration Directory

This directory is reserved for future Pixi-specific configurations and profiles.

## Potential Uses
- Environment-specific configurations
- Project templates
- Custom activation scripts
- Profile definitions for different use cases (minimal, dev, infra)

## Future Features
When Pixi supports user-level configuration files, they would go here:
- Global settings
- Default channels
- Authentication tokens
- Custom environments
