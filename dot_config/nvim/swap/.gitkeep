# Neovim Swap Directory

This directory is automatically created by Neovim configuration to store swap files.

## Purpose
- **Swap Files**: Stores temporary swap files during editing
- **Crash Recovery**: Enables recovery of unsaved changes after crashes
- **Performance**: Optimizes memory usage during large file editing

## Management
- Automatically managed by Neovim
- Swap files are typically temporary and cleaned up on normal exit
- Recovery prompts appear if swap files exist from previous crashes

This directory exists to ensure the swap directory structure is maintained in the repository.
